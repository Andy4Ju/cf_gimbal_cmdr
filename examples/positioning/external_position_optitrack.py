"""
Simple example that connects to one crazyflie, sets the initial position/yaw
and flies a trajectory.

The initial pose (x, y, z, yaw) is configured in a number of variables and
the trajectory is flown relative to this position, using the initial yaw.

This example is intended to work with any absolute positioning system.
It aims at documenting how to take off with the Crazyflie in an orientation
that is different from the standard positive X orientation and how to set the
initial position of the kalman estimator.
